Rue Space Shooter project demonstrates the Author's understanding of Game development through the Phaser 3 Framework. Phaser 3 is the next generation of the Phaser Game Framework. Every last element has been rebuilt from scratch using a fully modular structure, combined with a data-orientated approach. It includes a brand-new custom WebGL renderer designed specifically for the needs of modern 2D games.  


In this milestone, the following procedures were implemented, based on the final JavaScript Capstone specifications and requirements: -

1. Implementing a shooter game with Phaser library

2. Implementing a scoring system, so that when the user completes a game they are given a score (number)

3. Unit testing using Jest.
