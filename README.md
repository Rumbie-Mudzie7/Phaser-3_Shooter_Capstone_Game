Rue Space Shooter project demonstrates the Author's understanding of Game development through the Phaser 3 Framework. Phaser 3 is the next generation of the Phaser Game Framework. Every last element has been rebuilt from scratch using a fully modular structure, combined with a data-orientated approach. It includes a brand-new custom WebGL renderer designed specifically for the needs of modern 2D games.  


In this milestone, the following procedures were implemented, based on the final JavaScript Capstone specifications and requirements: -

1. Writing the functions that hit the API to take a location and return the weather data for  that location.

2. Writing the functions that process the JSON data being obtained from the API and returning an object with only the data required for the app.

3. Setting up a simple form that lets users input their location and fetch the weather information.

4. Displaying the information on your webpage.
